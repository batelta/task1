hi, 
this website page is about me , i had a hard time figuring out what i want to include here .. so in the end i made it partly professional but also a bit personal
also didnt have many projects to show unfortunatleyðŸ«¤


in this project i learned a lot of new things mainly about css but also javascript .
i found a website in which they have a lot of nice icons that i can download for free so i used a bunch of them as you'll see.
I learned how to make css animations , for example the title in my about page , its a simple code and the effect is cool .
in javascript i learned how to use functions in order to make the entire section float in 

i had a lot of challenges .. 
one was how to center every text and how to make it work for each screen size, so using Matan's advice i made changes on the web (inspect) and only after seeing that it fits i changes my code accordingly , this saved me a lot of time and helped me understand what each property does.
