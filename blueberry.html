 <h2>Blueberries may boost your mood</h2>
 <p>
British researchers fed young adults a cup and a half of blueberries, then measured effects on mood, memory and decision-making.
 Mood scores rose 15% five hours after blueberry consumption. 
 Researchers credit anthocyanins in berries for reducing inflammation, and the lower the inflammation, the higher the mood, according to the study.

 <h2>Enhance your memory</h2>
<p>
Emerging research suggests that compounds in blueberries known as flavonoids may improve memory, learning and general cognitive function, including reasoning skills, decision making, verbal comprehension and numerical ability.
In addition, studies comparing dietary habits with cognitive function in adults hint that consuming flavonoids may help slow the decline in mental facility that is often seen with aging and might even provide protection against disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
